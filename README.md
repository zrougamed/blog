# Blog Assets Repository

This repository contains **all assets and supporting materials used in my blog posts**.  
It serves as a centralized source of truth for visual, media, and reference files associated with published articles.

## What This Repo Contains

- Blog post banners and cover images
- Diagrams and architecture illustrations
- Screenshots and visual examples
- Supporting media (icons, figures, charts)
- Any additional materials referenced by blog posts

## Usage

Assets in this repository are intended to be referenced by:
- Blog articles
- Static site generators (Hugo, Gatsby, etc.)
- CMS platforms
- Documentation or cross-posted content

Paths should remain stable once a post is published to avoid broken references.
